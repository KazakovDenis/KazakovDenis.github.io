      <description>Salute! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Denis, I build backends in Python and Go. I love doing optimizations: diving deep into a problem and looking for solutions.
I am very interested in high-load distributed systems. I believe that a long-living project requires good test coverage and possibly ugly but strict code style. And MVP is MVP.
Love open source and studying programming languages development.
I am self-taught and have no computer science education, but before entering IT, I had some entrepreneurial and leadership experience, so I am well aware of how to prioritize business requirements and a technical debt.</description>

      <description>&amp;#x1f4a1; Contributions to open source I want to be useful for the community and suggest improvements for tools I use myself &amp;#x1f60a;.
Kafka-python One project had the need to get rid of Kafka&amp;rsquo;s consumer rebalances in order to provide constant reading from topics. However, none of the popular client libraries (kafka-python, confluent-kafka, pykafka) offered this functionality, despite the fact that it was already implemented in the 2.3.0 version of the broker.</description>

However, none of the popular client libraries (kafka-python, confluent-kafka, pykafka) offered this functionality, despite the fact that it was already implemented in the 2.3.0 version of the broker. I first implemented this feature by overriding KafkaConsumer in the project repository and then opened the Pull request. Unfortunately, the project is almost abandoned now.\nDjango extensions When I worked on a few new features, I often came across a situation where I had to switch between branches, roll back migrations of one branch, and apply migrations of another. As long as you work in the same Django app, no problems arise. But when migrations involve multiple Django applications, rolling back of each application becomes a frustrating chore.\nI wrote a Django command that captures a state of migrations on the current branch to a file and makes it easy to switch between branches.\nJaeger client Jaeger is a great code tracing tool. But one day I needed more flexible customization, which the configuration of the client library did not allow. I suggested applying dependency injection to the config class.\nüìÇ My projects Relatives - the service for building family trees I have long wanted to build a family tree, but I could not find suitable free tools for this, and those that were found did not meet my requirements. So I decided to reinvent the wheel. And at the same time to use some modern technologies for this, to get acquainted them better. That\u0026rsquo;s why I chose FastAPI with asynchronous ORM, although they are absolutely irrelevant, and Django could fit much better.\nFastAPI Ormar Asyncio\nSitemap generation library The library is published at PyPI, and the documentation is hosted at readthedocs.\nInitially, I only needed to add a sitemap to my Flask blog project. However, after I did not find a more or less attractive alternative, I decided to write my library, and at the same time learn how to publish it to the python package index. Then I decided to use it also to study various tools, for example, Sphinx.\nPython Sphinx\nFlask blog The blog was the first project which helped me in learning Flask and infrastructure to deploy and host Python apps. I still update it occasionally. For about a year and a half, this site worked using this particular engine.\nI deployed the blog to a bare metal server on VDSina.ru and launched CI / CD using Travis CI and Docker hub webhooks. In principle, having changed the necessary keys, it can be quickly deployed to an external server even now.\nFlask SQLAlchemy Docker Nginx Travis CI\nüéí Test tasks Merely I left a couple of tasks here, which turned out well.\nThe backend for content storage In this task, it was necessary to write an API with which it would be possible to get a list of pages with content and the video, audio, or text content itself.\nDjango REST framework Docker\nThe backend for survey service The task was to develop an API with which system administrators can log in, create, modify, delete surveys, and users can get a list of active, completed surveys and take part in them.

## Salute! 👋

My name is Denis, and I am a backend developer. I write in Python 🐍 and love doing optimization: 
diving deep into a problem and looking for solutions to it.

I am very interested in high-load distributed systems. I believe that a long-living project 
requires good test coverage and possibly ugly but strict code style. And MVP is MVP.

I have no computer science education, but before entering IT, I had some 
[entrepreneurial and leadership experience](#before-it), so I am well aware of how 
to prioritize business requirements and perfectionism.

## Experience

June 2021 - present
:   **Backend engineer**  
    [ITASystems](https://itasystems.ru) ([1cupis](https://1cupis.ru) project), Moscow  

    > I work on an antifraud for the payment system. I mostly do optimization - looking 
    > for bottlenecks and speeding up the service.   
    > Traces, metrics, partitioning, indexes, and the like are all related to what I do.

    > I developed backend and frontend for SaaS, an embedded product, and a small mobile application.
    >
    > Of the non-trivial things I had to do:
    > - an integration with ActiveDirectory (users sync)
    > - an embedded application for Xerox MFPs
    > 
    > Since the team was small, I took on some more unusual functions, such as: 
    > - working with customers: deploying boxed software in their infrastructure,
    > preparing for a presentation, consulting administrators
    > - working with outsourcing teams
    > - product delivery automation: 
    > packaging, uploading to S3, installation from S3 to the customer's local network
    > - publishing of a mobile application to Google Play and AppStore.

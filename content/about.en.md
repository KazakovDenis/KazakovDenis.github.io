## Salute! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denis, I lead one of Python :snake: teams at [1cupis](https://1cupis.ru). I love doing optimizations: 
diving deep into a problem and looking for solutions.

I am very interested in high-load distributed systems. I believe that a long-living project 
requires good test coverage and possibly ugly but strict code style. And MVP is MVP.
  
Love [open source](/projects/#-contributions-to-open-source) and well-expertised in Django, 
but I'd gladly change it for something else.   
  
I am self-taught and have no computer science education, but before entering IT, I had some 
[entrepreneurial and leadership experience](#before-it), so I am well aware of how 
to prioritize business and technical requirements.

    > - an integration with ActiveDirectory (users sync)
    > - an embedded application for Xerox MFPs
    > 
    > Since the team was small, I took on some more unusual functions, such as: 
    > - working with customers: deploying embedded software in their infrastructure,
    > preparing for a presentation, consulting administrators
    > - working with outsourcing teams
    > - product delivery automation:
